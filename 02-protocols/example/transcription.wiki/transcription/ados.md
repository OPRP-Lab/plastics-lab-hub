The main thing we transcribe are examiner-child interactions during a semi-structured, standardized, play-based assessment instrument called the ADOS-2, or the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (Second Edition). The ADOS is the “gold standard” for observational assessment of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). 

The ADOS-2 includes 5 modules, each requiring 40 to 60 minutes to administer. The individual being evaluated is given only one module, selected on the basis of his or her expressive language level and chronological age. The 5 modules are:

* Toddler Module—for ambulatory children between 12 and 30 months of age who do not consistently use phrase speech
* Module 1—for children 31 months and older who do not consistently use phrase speech
* Module 2—for children of any age who use phrase speech but are not verbally fluent
* Module 3—for verbally fluent children and young adolescents (i.e., complex utterances)
* Module 4—for verbally fluent older adolescents and adults

We mainly transcribe the ADOS-2 Module 3 assessments. As implied from the phrasing, subjects can stay on modules 1 and 2 if their speech doesn't become fluent as they get older. Typically we only transcribe module 3 because module 1 and 2 administrations don't have enough speech data, and our sources don't tend to use module 4 even for older teenagers. 

Modules 3 and 4 are supposed to be conducted without a parent in the room if the subject is over 6. Sometimes parents end up sitting in because the kid isn't comfortable without them, but these administrations are then considered nonstandard and can't be included in a lot of our analyses. So if the parents come in, the file probably shouldn't be transcribed (or should be transcribed last).  

Some module 3 administrations will switch to module 2 because the kid isn't using enough complex language to be eligible for a module 3. These are low priority to transcribe unless instructed otherwise.

The most detailed information can be found in the ADOS-2 manual, a large spiral-bound book that should be found with the other assessment manuals, on the little set of shelves between the mail cubbies and the admin office in GH40.

# ADOS Observations

All CSLU transcribers are asked to observe an ADOS Module 3 administration at OHSU's Child Development & Rehabilitation Center early in the training process. Email [faculty member name here] to set up a date/time to observe. We also encourage experienced transcribers to observe an ADOS in person every once in a while!

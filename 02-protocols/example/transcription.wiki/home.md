Welcome to the transcription wiki!

# Introduction

Welcome to the CSLU Research Assistant Institutional Knowledge Wiki!  The goal of this wiki is to collect all the tips, tricks, and good-to-know-s to make your fellow RA's day a little bit easier, without making the transcriber guidelines too overwhelmingly detailed.  

This is a work in progress!  Feel free to contribute and add to the knowledge base, but right now there may be a lot of drastic changes as everything gets set up.  Throw redlinks around, it'll be fun!

# Servers

The main server for transcription related purposes is asd, formally `asd.cslu.ohsu.edu`.

Some other servers you may hear about are bergamot (`login.cslu.ohsu.edu`), which is used to tunnel into internal servers from outside the network, and the Big Birds (`bigbirdN.cslu.ohsu.edu`), which are the center's computing cluster.  If someone wants you to work on one of these, they'll probably give you more information about it at the time.

# Raw Data Storage

There may come a day when you want to consult the raw source data for a project. The main data stored on-site is from ERPA -- UW and other shared projects do not have such raw data available.

* [Recordings] (datastorage/recordings)

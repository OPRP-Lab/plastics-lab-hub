[Pat Dickerson](mailto:dickersp@ohsu.edu) is your resource for office needs!

# Office Supplies

The office supplies are located in the cabinets near the sink in GH 40. These cabinets are stocked with the basics--paper, pencils, folders, highlighters, tissues, etc. If you want anything not available there, ask Pat and she can show you the secret storage or order items we don't have. (Pro-tip: ask about the fancy pens).

# Office Protocol
If you work in GH 30 or 40, please be sure to shut off lights and lock up if you are the last person out for the day. If youâ€™re unsure if anyone else is in, lock the door anyway. If you need after hours access, Pat can request keys for you. 

Locked out? Call public safety at 503-494-7744.

# Location

The Mini DVs containing all the video recordings from ERPA can be found in the supply closet in the back of GH30 (this can be opened with a master key). These are organized in labeled storage bins by subject -- if you remove one from the shelves, be sure to put it back in numerical order, and don't put tapes back in the wrong bins!

# Digitization Efforts

## ERPA ADOSes

All of the ERPA ADOS video recordings that existed in our storage have been digitized and uploaded to the server. They are located in

```
asd:/home/asd-lang/ERPA/ADOS/video/
```

## ERPA CELFs
There has been a partial digitization effort for the ERPA CELF video recordings -- you may be asked to resume this endeavor. 

Consult the [Airtable CELF digitization tracker] (https://airtable.com) to see the digitization progress and update as you upload more files. Notice that you should focus first on those labeled 'Completed' in the 'status' column. These are guaranteed to be CELF-4's (for older children), rather than CELF-2's (for preschoolers), and are more useful for our analyses.

The digitized videos are located in

```
asd:/home/asd-lang/ERPA/CELF/videos/
```

If you are asked to continue digitization:

* Locate the CELF cassette in a subject's bin. They may be labeled **OGI-XXX mm/dd/yy CELF**, but more commonly **OGI-XXX mm/dd/yy Language Testing**.

* There are multiple Canon Vixia HV40 camcorders floating around the office -- locate a working one and a charger (they need to be plugged in while digitizing). If these have all died, anything that plays Mini DVs and can connect to a computer should work. Put the tape in, switch it from **OFF** to **PLAY** (**not** to **CAMERA**, we don't want to record over them!!)

* Play through until you find where the CELF starts. Consult the CELF manual for reference if you're not familiar with the tasks, and look for the CELF administration book in the video. The other common tasks on this tape are:
   - the PPVT, a picture-naming task.
   - a task in which the child is asked to list things while being timed. These include the days of the week, months, and number patterns. The examiner uses a stopwatch in these tasks.

* Connect the camera to your computer with a FireWire cable.

* Start iMovie (or your preferred software). In iMovie, hit Import Media, find the connected camcorder in the Devices list, and start importing it.

* Digitization is done in real-time, so I recommend starting it and leaving it to progress for about an hour while you do other work.

* Again, these camcorders are old and on their last legs, so once it's finished, make sure it all made it on there. Sometimes it gets broken into lots of clips, which is super annoying and necessitates manually pasting them together and/or finding and re-uploading missed sections to make a single unbroken movie.

* Export your finished movie from iMovie, saved as a .mp4 for consistency, and upload it to the server

* Note your progress on the CELF Digitization progress spreadsheet.

There are two UW studies we have data from, UWL and UWG.  UWL is pretty much transcribed, UWG is a work in progress.

# UWL

This was a longitudinal study.  The files will have the format UWL-###-ADOS-#.wav .  The first set of three numbers is an ID number which stays consistent across timepoints.  The last number between 1 and 4 is the timepoint.  The kids were roughly 5, 8, 11, 14 across the timepoints. (**this may not be right, I'm pretty sure about spacing but not absolute ages!***)  Many kids dropped out at different points, which is noted on the AirTable spreadsheet.  

Time point 1 isn't usable because all the kids were too young for module 3, and only some of the kids ever made it to module 3. Also, a lot of time point 1 has the parent interview in the background while the kid plays.  There are a bunch of kids who came in just for time point 4 and only have one file; they tend to have the highest ID numbers.  

Many of the time point 4 transcripts were made before the current generation of transcribers, and the record-keeping was less strict in those days so some of the information about who transcribed which files and when has been lost forever.  That's why there are gaps on the spreadsheet about time point 4.  

Time point 1-3 recordings came off of VHS tapes shipped to us by UW and digitized at CSLU.  Some of the tapes were lost or damaged, or didn't contain an ADOS, and so those weren't transferred.  Time point 4 files came on DVD and are therefore a bit higher quality.  

# UWG

This study is currently being transcribed.  Files will have the format ###.03-ADOS.wav .

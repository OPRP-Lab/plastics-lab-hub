ERPA, Expressive and Receptive Prosody in Autism, was the old study done at CSLU long ago.  The prefix for ERPA is OGI-.  ERPA has been fully transcribed for quite some time; you'll only need to interact with it if someone specifically asks you to find or fix something.  

# Guidelines

ERPA was transcribed according to an older form of the guidelines that used significantly different conventions from the ones used now.  These guidelines are more like traditional SALT guidelines and include a lot more error marking and grammar marking as well as long comments.  If you need to do something in an ERPA file it's worth reading the original guidelines to make sure you follow that style.  

# Chronological

ERPA files, unlike the others, are saved as _chronological_ textgrids.  If you want to edit them in ELAN you have to load them into Praat first and export to non-chronological format before importing them into ELAN.  Similarly, when you finish you have to load them into Praat and convert them back to chronological.

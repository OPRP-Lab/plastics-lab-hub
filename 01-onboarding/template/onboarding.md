Use this template to document and reference resources, expectations, and policies for new lab members.  Adapt and refine the sections and examples provided here.

## Welcome Message
> Provide a brief introduction to your team.  Consider including the name and focus of your lab, and where it sits within the larger university environment.  **Let new members know how happy you are to have them on board and how they can use this information.**

## Parent Organization Resources & Processes
> Whether you are a new student, postdoc, or staff member, getting started at a new organization can be confusing and overwhelming.  Use this section to highlight the processes and resources relevant to new lab members.  

Examples:

* University intranet sites
* New employee onboarding checklists and paperwork
* Public Safety Office location and contact information
* University codes of conduct
* Staff and student organizations
* Parking and transportation
* Library website :book:
* Research development and grant management resources

## Department and Lab Specific Information
> Information about your department and lab that will help new members learn about your colleagues, connect with peers, and leverage educational opportunities.

Examples:

* Department website, faculty, and student pages
* Primary collaborators
* Seminars and journal clubs
* Lab publications list
* Professional development materials

:100: Pro-tip!  You can create and include links to your publication list from PubMed and other databases.  Ask your library for help :smile:

## Lab Policies and Guidelines
> Save time, reduce conflict, and build inclusion by clearly describing and documenting lab expectations and processes.  

Examples:

* Lab code of conduct
* Scholarly contributions and authorship
* Protocols
* Data management and repositories
* Project organization
* Open access policy
* Data privacy and data sharing

:100: Pro-tip!  A lab code of conduct, or COC, provides an opportunity to codify the organizational culture you want to foster, by clearly describing desired and unacceptable kinds of behavior and interpersonal communication.  

For example, like the [Hill Lab](https://github.com/apreshill/labhub/blob/master/01-onboarding/example/01-code-of-conduct.md) and the [Whitaker Lab](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/Onboarding/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), you can make clear that sexist and racist language or imagery are not acceptable, and that your lab is dedicated to providing a safe and inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion.

## Additional Resources and Readings
> Maybe your lab has a wiki, or your university sits at the top of a hill and one might need a little help finding the good food and drink :pizza: Think through the things you wish you knew when you first arrived - if they don't belong in one of the sections above, add them here.

Examples:

* [Where to find the best coffee on campus](https://github.com/apreshill/labhub/wiki/05-food-and-coffee)
* How to decipher the endless [list of acronyms](https://github.com/apreshill/labhub/wiki/04-CSLU-acronyms) your new colleagues are throwing at you :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

## Next Steps
> Make this material more actionable by asking new lab members to collaborate with you on a personalized onboarding plan.  And don't underestimate the value of their feedback on this material - welcome their contributions.

:100: Pro-tip!  Contributions will not only improve the quality of your labhub material, they help make it sustainable.

The purpose of this Code of Conduct is to affirm the good nature of our community while also acknowledging
that harassment happens even in seemingly safe spaces, and to provide clear definitions of what harassment
entails and how to report it if it does occur. This Code of Conduct applies to all team members at all CSLU/OHSU offices, presentations, 
talks, meetings, and all discussion forums including online and in person, Slack channels, GitHub, and
email.

OHSU and CSLU value the personal and academic contributions of every member of our community. Accordingly, we insist
that all lab members treat each other with respect, kindness, and dignity. Every community participant is
expected to uphold the standards of this Code of Conduct at all times. We are dedicated to providing a
welcoming, safe, and productive space for all, regardless of race, ethnicity, color, immigration status,
gender, gender identity or expression, sex, sexual orientation, age, disability, socio-economic class,
education level, political belief, body size, physical appearance, or religion.

We do not tolerate harassment in any form, including: offensive comments, violent language,
discriminatory language including jokes, deliberate intimidation, stalking, unwanted sexual or romantic
advances, unwanted photography or recording, sustained or willful disruption of talks or other events,
inappropriate or non-consensual physical contact, or use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or
jokes.

We strive for open communication, respect for all, and collaboration of work and ideas. We expect
everyone to conduct themselves professionally in all communication, both in person and online. Every
participant is an equally important member of our community and should be treated with kindness and respect.

While it is natural that both professional and personal disagreements will arise at the workplace, these
should be dealt with respectfully and in a non-threatening manner. Do not use ad hominem attacks when debating
issues. Use language that is productive in achieving a resolution. Understand that everyone has different
experiences, preferences, and perspectives. This diversity is a strength in our community and
miscommunications and disagreements should be handled in ways that resolve the issues, rather than inflaming
then. We all make mistakes--learning from them is what fosters a healthy and inclusive community.

Report violations of this code or harassment of any form to Alison, the project PI.
All communication will be treated with complete confidentiality. Please also reference this recent OHSU podcast on [preventing sexual harassment at OHSU](https://o2.ohsu.edu/blogs/staffnews/2017/11/28/ohsu-week-podcast-preventing-sexual-harassment-at-ohsu/). If you do not feel comfortable speaking with Alison, please contact the [OHSU Ombudsman](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/about/services/ombudsman/), who is available to all faculty, staff, administrators, students, post-doctoral fellows, trainees and volunteers. We take harassment very seriously, no matter the
experience, seniority, or role in the lab of either the perpetrator or the victim. People who report incidents will be believed and will not be dismissed.

Here are the current transcription guidelines: [SALT Conventions 2017]
(https://repo.cslu.ohsu.edu/language-outcomes/transcription/blob/master/guidelines/SALT_Conventions_2017.pdf)

What follows is a collection of weird examples that aren't covered in the guidelines, and don't necessarily merit their own section in the official document. This page should be used as a supplement to, but not in place of, the formal guidelines.

# Content Note
Sometimes what the kids talk about can be fairly distressing: intense bullying, trouble with their parents, violent tendencies. Be aware that there is protocol for addressing suspected child abuse, generally the examiner will try to finish the ADOS as per usual, but then at the end of their meeting may ask the child more pointed questions about it. Often this wouldn't be on the audio file that we receive, but that doesn't mean the examiner wasn't worried and didn't ask! The ADOS examiners are mandatory reporters and will follow up with anything they find concerning.

# C-Unit Segmentation  
If a speaker says a laundry list items of three identical phrase types (i.e., they are equal tiers on a syntax tree), they should be segmented as separate C-units. For example, "I mean like chips or apples or something" should be transcribed as "I mean like chips. Or apples. Or something." whereas "I mean like chips or something or apples" should be transcribed "I mean like chips or something. Or apples." This is a confusing distinction, and looking up syntax trees or discussing it with a linguist can help a lot.  


# Spelling  
For consistency, if one of these phrases come up, transcribe them as they appear here even if it's different from your own intuition. 
* P_B_and_J (connecting words are not capitalized)   
* Calvin_and_Hobbes  
* As/Bs/Cs/Ds/Fs (for grades)
* Four-hundred-and-something  
* Nine-and-a-half  
* Xbox_Three_Sixty  
* Big_Island (when talking about Hawaii)  
* Ann_Arbor, Michigan (place names follow the format City, State)  
* Valentines_Day (no apostrophe)
* super-frog (often said in context of Tuesday)    
* scooch (as in "scooch up your chair a bit")
* Sometimes the indefinite article "a" is hard to distinguish from the filled pause "uh". There's no magic rule to clarify this--but don't worry, it's not just you! People mumble. It sucks.  
* Don't mark g-dropping (e.g. "tryin'", "doin'")  

Generally beware of [eye dialect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_dialect), or the use of nonstandard spellings for normal phonological processes.  

If a child mispronounces a proper noun, transcribe it as it sounds, then place the correct spelling in square brackets. E.g. "Poke_Place_Market[=Pike_Place_Market]" or "A_F_O_Schwarz[=F_A_O_Schwarz]".  

#  Hyphenation  
Cake types always count as two words for the purposes of MLU: adjective and noun. If the cake type adjective is two words, then it must be hyphenated. Chocolate cake, carrot cake, white cake, birthday cake, wedding cake, pound cake, sponge cake; but red-velvet cake, key-lime pie, Boston-creme pie, blueberry-chocolate cake, black-forest cake.  
 
Note that "cheesecake" is an exception.  

# Media

A lot of kids will talk about games, TV shows, movies, etc. that they like.  If they mention an identifiable name of something you're not familiar with, it can help a lot to do a quick Google search for that thing; a lot of weird names/words will be much easier to recognize if you've seen them in print first.

# Play Sounds

The .ps marking covers a variety of sounds the kid might make during play. The same sound acoustically might be marked as .ns or another tag if used outside the play context; for example, the kid having one of the action figures yell in a fight would be .ps[child yell], whereas the kid yelling while the examiner is talking would be .ns[child yell].  

The line between play sounds and sound effects is indeed a bit fuzzy.

# Letter Sequences

The rules for letter sequences are to be used when the speaker actually pronounces each letter separately; letter sequences that are pronounced like words are spelled as proper nouns.  E.g. (for most speakers) Nasa vs the N_S_A.  

# Bracket Capitals

The _only_ notation in brackets that gets all caps is the "sounds like" notation.  E.g. "It was a XX[sounds like GERMAN_SHEPHERD]" vs "It was a German_Shep*[=Shepherd]"

# Repeated Activities

Sometimes an activity will happen twice.  For example, the examiner may return to an unfinished activity later in the ADOS to complete it.  Mark each of them with the activity name as normal, and make a note of it in the spreadsheet.  This includes multiple breaks (usually one is the Break activity and any others are breaks for food or medication) -- in this case, label them each as Break.

OHSU has a [formal page on this](http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/about/services/food-and-nutrition/where-to-eat/).

# Food (may also sell coffee)

* **Mac Hall** is in the first floor of Mackenzie Hall and has cafeteria style lunch.  They close at 4.
* **Thai Yummy** is a Thai food cart.  They close at 3 officially but usually more like 2.
* There's a **[farmer's market](http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/about/services/food-and-nutrition/farmers-market/index.cfm)** June-September on Tuesdays from 10-2 with several food carts/stalls. 
* **It's All Good** is the fancy natural food store, next to the gift store in the main hospital building.  It has some prepackaged food and lots of snacks.
* **Hatfield Cafe** is in Hatfield; they have deli fare at lunch and an espresso and pastry window 
* At the base of the tram: **Pizzicato/Lovejoy** (pizza mostly), **Cha! Cha! Cha!** (Mexican food), **Greenleaf** (fancy juice)
* On the waterfront: **Let's Eat Thai Food** (food cart; cheap and giant but a fair walk), **Bambuza** (Vietnamese), **Little Big Burger** (burgers). These are variously long walks, so they won't really fit on a standard lunch break.
* There is a **vending machine** outside GH40.  There is some formal process to request your money back if it eats it.  
* **The Feathered Nesst** is a quick walk from Gaines Hall and sells burgers, sandwiches, salad, etc; however, they are often slow.  This is a popular destination for going-away lunches.

# Coffee (may also sell food)

* Pat makes **coffee** (or you can too!)
* We have an **espresso maker** in the kitchen now--but bring your own beans!
* **Nightingale Cafe** is in the School of Nursing (get it?) on the first floor.  They close at 2pm and have coffee and pastries.
* **Sky Bridge Espresso** is where the VA skybridge and Doernbecher meet.  It closes at 3pm.  
* The **Summit Cafe**, at the top of the tram, is open until 4pm.
* There's a **Starbucks** in the lobby of Doernbecher that is usually open until 8pm, making it the last coffee shop to close in the area.

Welcome! This folder contains resources for team members who transcribe audio/video files for the project. We track transcription progress via the [Airtable Transcript Tracker](https://airtable.com).  Here's some info about [what to put there](transcription/tracking).

In this folder you'll find:

* [Useful scripts](scripts): for example, `upload.sh` is a Bash script that uploads your file to the right folder using rsync, assuming you have your username stored and asd aliased to asd.
* [Suggested readings](suggested-reading): these are papers about transcription itself that might be helpful to you (and are generally
interesting). Not required -- just here if you want them! Note that in-browser PDF rendering can scramble pages, so for the best reading experience, download and read locally.
* Data storage: there may come a day when you want to consult the raw source data for a project. There are two types of raw data:
  * [Paper Files](datastorage/files.md)
  * [Recordings](datastorage/recordings.md)
* All about transcribing: includes lots of good-to-know info such as...

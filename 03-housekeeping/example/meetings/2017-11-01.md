**Article Presentation**

- @superstarphdstudent1 presented a paper titled "Linguistic camouflage in girls with autism spectrum disorder" by Julia Parish-Morris, published 2017, Molecular Autism.
- The article can be found [here](https://molecularautism.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13229-017-0164-6?site=molecularautism.biomedcentral.com).
- Important differences in methods discussed:
    - Their utterances are breath segmented as opposed to c-units
        - Thus, the MLU is different from ours
    - They use the "interview" segments of the ADOS--emotions, social difficulties, friends, relationships, & marriage, loneliness; we used all sections
    - They count all disfluency, instead of just the first per utterance

**Pedantic Speech Presentation**

## Transportation

### The Great Tram Debate

If you take the tram up the hill, there are two ways to get to Gaines Hall.

* The Outdoor Way: walk straight away from the tram, either out the front doors toward the ER or juke around to the left until you hit the next set of doors.  Walk past the library then turn left before phys plant.  Walk on the swoopy path past the apartment building/Feathered Nesst.  Cross the street to School of Nursing.  Either enter the SoN and go up via the internal stairs/elevator, or go to the right and take the steep stairs up.  Cross the street to Gaines Hall.

* The Indoor Way:  walk straight away from the tram, juke left then turn left at the gift store.  Turn right at the coffee shop which puts you into the Doernbecher skybridge.  Cross the skybridge then take the stairs to your left one floor up.  Turn left from the stairs and walk outside.  Cross the street, then walk up to the enclosed bridge.  Take a left out of the enclosed bridge to the parking lot and walk up Gaines Street to Gaines Hall on the left.

People have opinions about which of these you should take.  Steven Bedrick timed them and says they take the same amount of time.  It's up to you.  

### Parking

Parking for non-patients is intentionally hard up here (the city doesn't want the traffic jam of everyone driving up the hill), so if you're going to work a full day it's usually easier to use transit and/or bike.  If you do drive, there's 3-hour pay parking on Gaines and a 2-hour visitor parking zone up towards the nature park.  The parking is enforced pretty strictly so you do risk a ticket if you overstay.  If you move your car within the visitor zone they can still ticket you for overstaying.  In the pay parking you have to switch blocks and/or sides of the street after 3 hours, and buy a new ticket.

Also, if you're coming from the east it's easier to take Barbur and turn up Bancroft than it is to take the front way; this skips most of the traffic.  However it is a very sharp turn and a somewhat steep hill so be careful.  

### GPS

Sometimes telling people "Gaines Hall" will erroneously send them to the waterfront, but "SW 9th and Gaines" usually works.

The physical address for Gaines Hall is 840 SW Gaines Street, Portland, OR, 97239

### Go By Bike

There is a [free bicycle valet](http://www.gobybikepdx.com) at the base of the tram, open from 6 AM to 7:30 pm when the tram is running. You can swipe your badge and they'll use that to store which bike is yours; otherwise you can get a physical claim check for your bike.  Bikes are stored in a guarded lot, so you don't have to lock them or strip off your bike accessories.  They'll usually have bags to cover your seat if it's rainy, but you may wish to take your helmet with you on wet days.

They have a small attached bike shop that can do minor repairs like fixing a flat tire.

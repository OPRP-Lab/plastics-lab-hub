You may come into possession of a set of filing cabinet keys (Pat has copies of these as well). The green-capped key (labeled '4-tier') unlocks the cabinet inside the double-door closet next to the mail cubbies in GH40. This cabinet contains paper files for ERPA and PAIRS subjects. The blue-capped key (labeled 'Tall') opens the tall five-drawer cabinet next to this closet, which also contains ERPA files. The key with no colored cap but a red tag labeled '103R' opens the black filing cabinet in GH30, which contains the remainder of the ERPA files. At this point, all of this data has been entered into REDCap, so there isn't really a reason you would need to look at it, but it's there if you need it.

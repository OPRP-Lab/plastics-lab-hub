In this project, we'll use data from several different sources, and the file location depends on the type of data (text files, flat files like .csvs). We'll organize this by corpora:

# ERPA

This was data collected at OHSU between 

**Text files of ADOS transcripts** are stored on the asd server: asd.cslu.ohsu.edu:transcripts/TextGrid/chronTextGrid_merged_by_subject/

**Participant-level data** is stored in REDCap (Email Alison for access using your OHSU username and password): https://octri.ohsu.edu/redcap/
The project is called `OCTRI 10001 ERPA: Expressive & Receptive Prosody in Autism - Version 2`

# Additional cloud storage

[OHSU provides](http://www.ohsu.edu/blogs/researchnews/2014/08/05/cloud-storage-now-available-for-ohsu-researchers/) you an institutional Box.com account, which is the only approved cloud storage that fits OHSU's data protection policy: https://ohsu.app.box.com/login

# Servers

The main server for transcription related purposes is asd, formally `asd.cslu.ohsu.edu`.

Some other servers you may hear about are bergamot (`login.cslu.ohsu.edu`), which is used to tunnel into internal servers from outside the network, and the Big Birds (`bigbirdN.cslu.ohsu.edu`), which are the center's computing cluster.  If someone wants you to work on one of these, they'll probably give you more information about it at the time.

# Raw Data Storage

There may come a day when you want to consult the raw source data for a project. The main data stored on-site is from ERPA -- UW and other shared projects do not have such raw data available.

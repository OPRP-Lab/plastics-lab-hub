The following table is a log of all the documented formal and informal changes made to the transcription guidelines from the ERPA guidelines created in 2012 to the current guidelines used today; this should cover all of the guidelines used at CSLU for ADOS transcription.  

A dash in a cell indicates that there was no change to the previous guidelines, or (if no previous guideline) that there was no information about this rule.

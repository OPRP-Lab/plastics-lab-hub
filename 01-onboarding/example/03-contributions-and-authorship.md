We appreciate your contributions to our ongoing research projects, and we are happy to discuss with you how you can make authorable contributions to a future paper, poster, or conference presentation. For research staff and volunteers, please keep in mind that these endeavors often involve work above and beyond your job or volunteer position descriptions, and may require additional hours outside of your defined responsibilities.

# Guidelines for authorship

In this project, we follow the [Harvard Authorship guidelines](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/faculty-affairs/authorship-guidelines/). The guidelines are as follows:

1. Everyone who is listed as an author should have made a substantial, direct, and intellectual contribution to the work. For example, they should have contributed to the conception, design, analysis and/or interpretation of data. Honorary or guest authorship is not acceptable. Acquisition of funding and provision of technical services, patients, or materials, while they may be essential to the work, are not in themselves sufficient contributions to justify authorship.

2. Everyone who has made substantial and direct intellectual contributions to the work should be an author. Everyone who has made other substantial contributions should be acknowledged.

3. When research is done by teams whose members are highly specialized, individuals’ contributions and responsibility may be limited to the specific aspects of the work described in the publication.

4. All authors should contribute to writing the manuscript, reviewing drafts and approving the final version.

5. One author (usually the Principal Investigator) should take primary responsibility for the work as a whole even if he or she does not have an in-depth understanding of every part of the work. This individual should assure that all authors meet the basic criteria for authorship outlined in guideline 1.

6. The authors should make every effort to decide the order of authorship together. Research teams should discuss authorship issues frankly early in the course of their work together and at other times during their collaboration as needed. It is recommended that the PI write up a summary of the authorship agreement. To assist with this, these guidelines should be distributed to all team members at the start of the collaboration.

7. If there is an authorship dispute, every effort should be made to settle it at the local level by the authors themselves, the research PI and/or the Department Chair.

# Order of authorship

Also from the [Harvard guidelines](https://hms.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/assets/Sites/Ombuds/files/AUTHORSHIP%20GUIDELINES.pdf):

1. The authors should decide the order of authorship together.

2. Authors should specify in their manuscript a description of the contributions of each author and how they have assigned the order in which they are listed so that readers can interpret their roles correctly.

3. The primary author should prepare a concise, written description of how order of authorship was decided.

# Who is an author?

According to the [International Committee of Medical Journal Editors' (ICMJE) "Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals"](http://www.icmje.org/icmje-recommendations.pdf), authorship should be based on the following 4 criteria:

1. Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; AND

2. Drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content; AND

3. Final approval of the version to be published; AND

4. Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.

Some specific peer-reviewed journals enforce their own additional authorship criteria, so the above are necessary but not sufficient criteria.

In addition to being accountable for the parts of the work he or she has done, an author should be able to identify which co-authors are responsible for specific other parts of the work. 

In addition, authors should have confidence in the integrity of the contributions of their co-authors.

# Non-author contributors

Contributors who meet fewer than all 4 of the above criteria for authorship should not be listed as authors, but they should be acknowledged. Examples of activities that alone (without other contributions) do not qualify a contributor for authorship are acquisition of funding; general supervision of a research group or general administrative support; and writing assistance, technical editing, language editing, and proofreading. Those whose contributions do not justify authorship may be acknowledged individually or together as a group under a single heading (e.g. “Clinical Investigators” or “Participating Investigators”), and their contributions should be specified (e.g., “served as scientific advisors,” “critically reviewed the study proposal,” “collected data,” “provided and cared for study patients”, “participated in writing or technical editing of the manuscript”).

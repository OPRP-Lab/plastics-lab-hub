# ID conventions
Most files from ADHD have the prefix ADHD.  A few have the prefix ADHD02, which is for follow-up ADOSes administered later. 

The ID number after the prefix is a subject ID.  The last digit is almost always 1 because it's used to track siblings in the study; if it's greater than 1, then there's multiple siblings in the study sharing the rest of the ID.  This doesn't affect anything, it's just a fun fact.

The software used to record the ADHD ADOSes and send them to us requires that they use a pre-existing ID to record the file. Sometimes this causes issues when they can't connect to our server to make a new ID.  To deal with this, they have pre-designed IDs to temporarily save files until they can get the file linked to the proper ID number.  This is what the ADHDNA prefix is for.  It's also the reason behind odd ID numbers like 99999.

Use this template to start identifying and documenting procedures that are regular and essential to the everyday happenings and forward momentum of your lab.  

The point here isn't to detail experimental protocols.  Rather, think about the workflows that ensure you and your team have the information and materials needed to perform and communicate your research.

## Recognize What is Regular
> Make a list of the recurring activities that take place in your lab on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.

Examples:

* Accessing servers
* Ordering supplies
* Lab meetings
* Maintaining equipment
* Running scripts
* Progress reports

## The Who, What, When, Where & Why
> For each activity note its purpose, the actions needed to complete the task, individual and organizational roles, the timeline, where needed information or materials live, and where it takes place.

## Describe the Procedure
> Once you've broken down the full context of an activity (those 5 Ws above), translate it into a set of instructions.  A good protocol is self-contained, so readers shouldn't have to hunt for additional information to understand a task or take action.

:100: Pro-tip!  Update your protocols regularly and don't forget about authentication.  There are many activities, like reporting, that require access to protected databases and personal information.  Don't share passwords!  Many of these systems, like NIH NCBI and eRA Commons, have delegate access capabilities.

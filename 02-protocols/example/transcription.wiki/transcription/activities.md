# Construction Task

**Not transcribed**

* This is the first task.  The examiner will ask the kid to put some blocks on a picture.  At the end they might ask the kid what the shape looks like to them.  

* Cues: 

    * [start of the tape]

# Play

* The sound of taking out the toys is usually the biggest cue to play.  
* The most common set of toys has three action figures (two male one female), a dinosaur, and a collection of stuff: fire-truck, hot-dog, chocolate bar, miniature CD-type disc, etc.  The toy set for FNL has the wrong sword for the female action figure and it looks notably mis-sized.  
    * There's an alternate set of toys that have a family including a baby.  Some administrations use these instead, usually when a Module-3 administration occurs with a very young child (3,4, maybe 5).  
* They are supposed to introduce the characters as "wrestler, superhero, warrior, and their things." 
* The task is actually in two parts.  First the kid plays on their own then the examiner asks to join.  
* Some kids really just make sound effects, particularly in the first part.  
* This is probably the most commonly refused task.  Older kids will sometimes do a very short one, too.  

* Cues: 

    * So I've got some things here.
    * So I've got like a ... space guy, army guy, warrior princess, and their pet dinosaur, and here are some of their things.
    * I've got some toys for you to play with.

# Demonstration Task

**Not transcribed**

* This task is often framed as the examiner being an alien who needs to be taught how to brush their (shockingly human-like) teeth.

* Cues:

    * So now I'd like to play a different kind of pretend game.

# Picture Description

* There are three pictures they might use.

    * The most common is a novelty map of the United States with different cartoons showing stuff iconic for each state -- landmarks like the Space Needle and the Golden Gate Bridge as well as activities and objects like a gambler for Vegas and an oil well for Texas.  The examiner will typically try to start a conversation about vacations the kid's been on and/or where the kid is from.  

    * The second most common is a picture of people doing different activities at a beach resort.  This one will also typically segue into a chat about vacations.

    * The rarest (used more in ERPA) is a picture of a Thanksgiving feast.  The examiner might ask how the kid celebrates Thanksgiving. (this is usually for Mod-2).

* Cues:

    * Now I've got a picture here...

# Wordless Picture Book

* There are three different books, but it's almost always the first.
    * The main book is _Tuesday_ by David Wiesner.  Pictures from it can be found online.  It's a story about a night where frogs spontaneously start to fly on their lily-pads and have adventures around a town.  At the end we see that pigs fly the next week.  The examiner may ask the kid if they've heard the phrase "when pigs fly" and if they know what it means. (This is not part of a standard administration.)
    * An alternative book is _Free Fall_, also by David Wiesner, which is a story about a kid daydreaming.  They often offer the kid the choice between this book and _Tuesday_, and the kids tend to go for the frogs.
    * A few files will use _Good Night, Gorilla_ by Peggy Rathmann.  This is often a sign that the kid is less verbal and that they might switch to the ADOS Module 2, so check the rest of the file if you see it!  (Or also used with very young children who are appropriate for a Module 3 (ages 3, 4, maybe 5).  

* Cues:

    * Now I've got this book here...

# Cartoons

* There are three different cartoons.  FNL tends to use the fisherman, UW often uses the others.

    * A fisherman and his cat are fishing.  The fisherman puts the fish into the bucket.  The cat steals it and puts it in what looks like his own bucket, but is actually the beak of a pelican.  The pelican flies away and the cat is angry.
    * A monkey is in a tree. He drops coconuts out of the tree and they are stolen by another monkey.  The tree monkey waits for the thief monkey to come back and drops a coconut on his head.
    * [UW-Estes only, timepoint 2 & 3] A Spy vs Spy cartoon involving using a "peanut potion" to lure elephants.  The examiner may not recognize it and may describe the spies as mosquitoes. (I have never need this cartoon- it does not come with the ADOS-2 kit.)

* The reason they ask the kids to stand up and take their hands out of their pockets is actually to see if they'll spontaneously gesture as they tell the story.

* Cues:

    * Now I've got some cartoons...

# Conversation and Reporting

* This gets a long description in the main guidelines because it's hard to define.  The main point is that it's for when the examiner initiates a conversation that's not really related to the last activity.  It is generally used when there has not been enough spontaneous conversation and reporting once the examiner gets to this section.  If plenty have already occurred, it is generally not used as a stand-alone "activity." 

* One of the examiners for UW GENDAAR often conducts C&R as the very last activity after Creating a Story, so make sure to check the very end of the file!

* Common Topics:

    * Does the kid have pets
    * Describe a day at school/general questions at school
    * What will the kid do after the visit
    * The kid's hobbies

* UWG examiner's questions:

    * Does the kid have any hobbies
    * How did the kid get into (kid's hobby)
    * Has the kid done anything related to (kid's hobby) recently?
    * "Can you tell me about a time when you felt bullied or picked on or treated unfairly?"
    * Does the kid have siblings?
    * (If so) What's nice about being a sibling?
    * (If so) What's hard about being a sibling?
    * (If so) What's unique about being a sibling?

# Emotions

* Relaxed/content is optional; it's there in case ending on sad is too depressing.  (The manual states that if the first two responses are excellent, the rest are all optional.)
 
* Cues:

    * So now I just have some questions about feelings kids have

# Social Difficulties and Annoyance

* Cues:

    * Have you ever had problems getting along with people at school?

# Break

**Not transcribed**

* There's a bunch of things for the kid to play with including a radio.  If you hear the radio on it's probably Break.  
*The examiner approaches the kid at the end.  There will often be some conversation at the end of Break, which is currently not transcribed.  

* Cues: 

    * Now I have some stuff to write down here so I need to take a little break.
    * Now I need to take a break...

# Friends and Marriage

* Cues:

    * Do you have some friends? Tell me about them.

# Loneliness 

* This section is almost always much shorter than the others.  There are a lot fewer prompts to it.

* Cues:

    * Do you ever feel lonely?

# Creating a Story

**Transcription status TBD**

* The examiner pulls five things out of a box and makes a story with them.  Then the kid is asked to do the same.  
* Since this is the last activity, there's often other stuff at the end of it e.g. the kid packing up, getting a sticker, etc.
* Cues:
    * One last thing...

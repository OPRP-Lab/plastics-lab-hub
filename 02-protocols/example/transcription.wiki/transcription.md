This page is a big picture overview of how to transcribe and why we do it.  We hope at least one experienced transcriber will be around to talk about this in person too.  

# Transcription Goals

Most transcribers have historically had a linguistics background.  This section may be a bit redundant for those who do.

The goal of transcription is to preserve what the child actually said, in a form amenable to study.  The whole idea of _actually said_ is not nearly as simple as it sounds; we necessarily make choices about what details are relevant to include in a transcript.  That said, speech is messy.  Some of the children whose tapes we're transcribing may have language disorders and other conditions that influence their speech, but even the adult examiners will display some non-standard speech at times -- everyone does.  If you haven't transcribed before you will be tempted to clean up the child's speech into something closer to a novel or script.  One of the main tasks of learning to be a transcriber is learning to hear the words as they were said, and write them down, messy as they may be.  

# Uses for the Transcripts

The transcripts are used for a variety of automated analyses.  We can't prepare for every possible future use, but there will probably be new analyses conducted that we can't predict yet.  We don't want to focus on only a few predicted uses and thus unduly influence the transcripts, but knowing what transcripts will be used for downstream can help us choose which phenomena deserve special notation.  It's also helpful to have enough information in a transcript that a human can read it and figure out what's going on, but this is more for troubleshooting; most of the publications based on our transcripts have to do with a computational analysis.  

One set of measures commonly used to study the transcripts includes MLU (mean length of utterance -- an important measure and the reason so many rules revolve around what counts as one word) as well as `other stuff`.

Some things that have been studied include turn-taking, mazes, and pedantic speech.  

# Transcriber Training

New transcribers start off by studying the transcription guidelines, then transcribe the gold standard file.  The gold standard file is a file that already has a transcription generally agreed to be of high quality.  The current one is ADHD-83322-ADOS (no peeking!).  Then experienced transcribers compare the new transcriber's transcription to the gold standard and offer advice and guidance based on the differences.  There are certain parts of transcribing that are objective, so the goal isn't necessarily to have character-for-character the same transcript, but this is a good way to get used to the conventions and learn to avoid common mistakes.  

In addition to the version on asd, there are two other versions of the gold standard file made by other transcribers and revised in a group discussion.  All canonical versions of the gold standard transcription can be found at `asd:/home/langauge/Transcription/gold_standard`.  The point of keeping multiple versions is to make it easier for trainers to see if the new transcriber is showing normal human variation in judgement or making actual mistakes.  

# Standardization Measures  

Every September and March all working transcribers need to do a standardization check. Anyone who is transcribing at the time needs to share a transcript with their fellow transcribers at some point during that month. Transcribers should review each other's work and discuss any discrepancies. This is to ensure that transcribers remain standardized to both the guidelines and each other.
